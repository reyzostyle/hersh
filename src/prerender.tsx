// and do not wait for React, which meant every word of the landing page was
// invisible to them.

// This renders the public routes to static markup at build time. It is NOT
// server-side rendering and there is no hydration: main.tsx still uses
// createRoot, which discards whatever sits in #root and renders fresh. So the
// prerendered markup exists purely to be read before JavaScript runs, and it
// cannot desynchronise from the live app - the live app overwrites it.
