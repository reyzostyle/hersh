# Chumoku on the App Store: launch checklist

State on 2026-10-30. What is in code is done and builds (Debug and Release).
Everything below the line "Ivan" needs the paid Developer account or a click
in a dashboard.

## Done in code

- Ideas, Chat, Settings (the web's settings, minus Stripe cancel, codes and
  affiliate). Filming and the editor are hidden (`Features.filming = false`).
- Sign in with Apple, email, Google. Account deletion in the app, including
  revoking the Apple grant once the key below is set.
- In-app purchases (StoreKit 2): Plus and Pro, monthly and yearly, and a
  50-credit top-up. Checked server-side against Apple's signature
  (`apple-iap`), renewals and refunds through `apple-notifications`. The plans
  open by themselves when credits run out.
- English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Japanese. Ideas,
  scripts and the chat come back in the language picked in Settings
  (default: the phone's).
- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO`, version 1.0.0
  build 1, `Chumoku.storekit` for testing purchases in the simulator.

## Server (one command each, needs a yes)

1. Migrations, in this order, in the SQL editor (not `db push`, see memory):
   `20261030000000_lock_user_tokens_paid_columns.sql`,
   `20261030010000_apple_iap.sql`, `20261030020000_user_language.sql`.
   The first one closes a hole that exists today on the web too: any signed-in
   user can set their own `plan` and `credits_used` from the browser console.
2. Deploy: `apple-iap`, `apple-notifications --no-verify-jwt`, `delete-account`,
   and every function that now reads the language: `write-script`,
   `chat-followup`, `steal-video`, `generate-outline`,
   `enrich-competitor-video`, `daily-ideas`, `build-brain`, `sync-retention`,
   `analyze-upload`, `analyze-with-gemini`, `pitch-ideas`.

## Ivan, after buying the Developer Program

1. **Team.** Put the new Team ID in `ios/project.yml` (`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`), run
   `xcodegen generate`. Trust the new certificate on the iPhone once.
2. **Agreements.** App Store Connect → Business: sign the Paid Apps agreement,
   add bank and tax info. In-app purchases do not load at all until this is
   done. Apply for the Small Business Program (15% instead of 30%).
3. **The app.** App Store Connect → Apps → New: iOS, name `Chumoku`, bundle
   `co.chumoku.app`, SKU `chumoku-ios`, primary language English (U.S.).
   Copy its Apple ID (a number, App Information) into the Supabase secret
   `APPLE_APP_ID`. Until it is set only TestFlight/sandbox purchases verify.
4. **Purchases.** Monetization → Subscriptions → group `Chumoku`:
   | Product ID | Name | Price | Level |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `co.chumoku.app.pro.monthly` | Pro | $19.99 / month | 1 |
   | `co.chumoku.app.pro.yearly` | Pro | $155.99 / year | 1 |
   | `co.chumoku.app.plus.monthly` | Plus | $9.99 / month | 2 |
   | `co.chumoku.app.plus.yearly` | Plus | $119.99 / year | 2 |

   In-App Purchases → Consumable `co.chumoku.app.credits50`, "50 credits",
   $4.99. Each one needs a display name, a one-line description and a review
   screenshot (the Plans screen). Prices are the web's; Apple keeps 15%.
5. **Notifications.** App Information → App Store Server Notifications, V2,
   production and sandbox both:
   `https://ezlousklksipvwuinpzq.supabase.co/functions/v1/apple-notifications`
6. **Sign in with Apple key.** Certificates, IDs & Profiles → Keys → new key
   with Sign in with Apple, for `co.chumoku.app`. Secrets:
   `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_SIGNIN_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_SIGNIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (the
   .p8 file's text). Without it, deleting an account still works but the
   Apple grant is not revoked, which review can flag.
7. **Google sign-in.** Supabase → Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs
   must contain `chumoku://auth-callback`, or the Google button fails in the
   app and review rejects it (2.1). Check before submitting.
8. **Review account.** An email/password account with a built brain, a few
   saved ideas and Plus, so the reviewer sees everything without connecting
   YouTube. Put it in Review Notes (below).
9. **Sandbox tester.** Users and Access → Sandbox → a test Apple ID, signed in
   on the iPhone under Settings → Developer, to buy without paying.
10. **Upload.** Xcode → Product → Archive → Distribute App → App Store Connect.
    TestFlight first, buy each product once with the sandbox tester, then
    submit.

  Every morning Chumoku finds Shorts that just did far better than their channel usually does, and turns each one into an idea for your channel: same format, your subject, your audience.

  Like one, and a press writes the script in the way you actually talk, built from your own uploads. Ask the chat anything about your channel, an idea or a draft, and it answers knowing what has worked for you before.

  - Ideas every day, picked for your niche
  - A script from any idea in one press
  - A chat that knows your channel and your numbers

### Review notes

Chumoku gives YouTube Shorts creators video ideas every day and writes scripts for them.

Demo account: <email> / <password> (Plus plan, profile already set up).

- Ideas tab: today's ideas. Tap one, then "Write my script" (uses credits).
- Chat tab: ask about the channel or an idea.
- Settings → Plan: the subscriptions and the credit top-up, all through In-App Purchase.
- Settings → Delete account: deletes the account and all its data.
- Connecting YouTube is optional and read-only (youtube.readonly, yt-analytics.readonly).

People who subscribed on our website keep that plan when they sign in here; the app never links to or mentions purchasing outside the App Store.
