// that beat their usual, but that is the exception (Ivan, same day: "find
// ideas, don't rework old videos; reworking is fine if it's good, not the main
// thing").
//
// Nothing has tested them, so they are rows of their own kind (source 'ai', no
// real video behind them) and the client draws them as a script, not a Short.
// `video_id` is a made-up `ai-` key only because the table is unique on
// (user_id, video_id) and save, dismiss and chat all key on it; nothing ever
// loads it as a YouTube id.
//
// One web search and one writer call per batch.

## Fresh in their subject (web search, today is ${today})
${fresh || 'Search unavailable today: use what you know of their subject, and nothing you are unsure is real.'}

Write ${count} video ideas for them.
- Most are NEW (kind "research"): a subject they have not posted, found in the fresh list above or in what you know of their subject, that fits their channel: the same subject area, the same kind of viewer, a format they already make. Take the format and tone from what beat their usual.
- At most one in four may be a "remix": one of their uploads that beat their usual, pushed into a new angle. Never a remake of a video they already posted.
- Every fact you use must come from the fresh list or be something you are sure of. Never invent a release, a number or a quote.

For each idea:
- kind: "research" or "remix"
- pitch: the working title, under 80 characters, the way they would title it, no hashtags. Not advice, not "Make a video about".
- premise: two short sentences, what happens on screen.
- hook: the first line they say on camera, under 90 characters.
- source: for research, what it is based on, under 50 characters (like "Claude Code web launch, Oct 20"); for a remix, the number of the upload.
- why: under 70 characters, why it fits them now. Plain words, no numbers.
