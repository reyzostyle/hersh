${profileBlock}${scanBlock}

Competitor video:
Title: ${title}
Views: ${views.toLocaleString()}
Performance: ${outlierScore ? `${outlierScore}x this channel's usual views per day - it outperformed their baseline` : 'N/A'}
${transcript ? `Transcript: ${transcript}` : 'This video has no captions, so you are watching it instead. Read the visuals: what is on screen in the opening second, where the cuts land, what any text overlay says.'}

Extract three things, in this order. The order is the method, not a formatting preference.

1. CONCEPT: what this video is and why it beat the channel's other uploads. 2-3 sentences. Topic included.

2. MECHANISM: the structural move that made it work, with the subject stripped out completely. Describe only the machine underneath: what the first frame shows, what tension is set up, what is withheld, where the turn lands, what the payoff is.
   BANNED from this field: any product, any brand, any software, any price, any money, and any category noun from the competitor's world (tool, app, agent, editor, gym, recipe, and so on). Write about the moves and about what each one does to the viewer's attention, nothing else.
   The test: if someone reading only your mechanism could guess what the competitor's video was about, you have not stripped it. Rewrite it.
   Right level: "open on a number the viewer finds painful, publicly wreck the thing it belongs to, then reveal something that does the same job for nothing, and prove the gap with one side-by-side."
   Wrong level: "compare a paid option with a free open-source alternative." That is still the topic wearing a coat.

3. ADAPTED_IDEA: the mechanism from step 2, applied to something THIS creator already makes videos about.
   Write it as 2-3 sentences describing the video they should make: what it is about, and what to put on screen at the turn. End with one working title in quotes.
   Do not return a list of titles. Do not return three alternatives. One idea, described.

The adapted idea is where this usually goes wrong, so check it against all three of these before you write it:
- The subject must come from THEIR channel, not from the competitor's. Swapping one noun in the competitor's topic is not adaptation. If the competitor's subject survives into your answer in any form, start again.
- They must plausibly be able to film it. Do not hand them a topic that needs expertise, footage, credentials or a job they do not have. ${niche ? `Their niche is "${niche}"` : 'They have not filled in a niche, so work entirely from what they publish'}, and their uploads above are what "their channel" means. Anything outside that is a wasted idea.
- Ask yourself: could this title sit in their upload list without looking like it belongs to someone else? If not, it is wrong. Rewrite it.

A competitor from a completely different niche is not a problem and is often the best case: the mechanism is what transfers, and one that arrives from another field is one their audience has not seen worn out. Carry the mechanism, never the subject.

Focus on what made this specific video out-perform the channel's other uploads, not on generic advice. Never open with a hedge about not knowing their niche - you have their uploads, use them.

Rules:
- Never use em-dash or en-dash. Only regular hyphen (-).
- Respond with JSON only.

The angle already worked out for them: ${adaptedIdea}

${profileBlock}${scanBlock}

Watch it properly first. Note how the first frame is composed, what is on screen in the opening second, where the cuts land, what any text overlay says, and how long it sits before the payoff. Those are the parts that do not survive into a transcript, and they are what you are here to carry over.

Then write the outline for the creator's own version: same structural moves, their subject matter, their register. Say what to SHOW, not only what to say.

Follow this exact JSON format:

{
  "hook": "exact hook text spoken in first 3 seconds - make it punchy and attention-grabbing",
  "sections": [
    { "title": "Section name", "content": "what to say or show in this section", "duration": "10s" },
    { "title": "Section name", "content": "what to say or show in this section", "duration": "15s" },
    { "title": "Section name", "content": "what to say or show in this section", "duration": "20s" }
  ],
  "cta": "closing line that drives engagement or follow"
}

Rules:
- 3 to 4 sections total
- Hook must be the first thing said, not an intro
- Sections should build logically toward a payoff
- CTA should feel natural, not forced
- Every section names something visual, not just a line to say
- No em-dash or en-dash, only regular hyphen (-)
- Respond with JSON only, no markdown`;
