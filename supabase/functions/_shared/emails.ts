// Onboarding drip copy + markup.
//
// Kept as one module so the worker stays plumbing and the words live in a
// single place you can edit without touching delivery logic.
//
// Markup rules that email clients force on us, and why this looks dated:
//   - table wrapper, not flexbox: Outlook's Word renderer ignores modern CSS
//   - every style inlined: Gmail strips <style> blocks in many contexts
//   - the CTA is a padded <a>, not a <button>: buttons don't render reliably
//   - explicit colours on every element: clients inject their own defaults,
//     and a dark shell with inherited text colour goes black-on-black
// Each email ships a text/plain twin. That isn't politeness, it's
// deliverability: HTML-only mail scores as spammier almost everywhere.

// The app's own tokens, hex-frozen. Email clients cannot read CSS variables, so
// these are copies of :root in src/index.css and have to be updated with it.
//
// They were a different product's colours until now: a #0EA4E9 blue button on a
// navy card, from before the redesign. The blue was the thing that made the app
// look generated, and removing it was the point - white is the accent and the
// only filled action, and green means process, never decoration. An email is
// the first thing a new account sees, so it was the one surface still shipping
// the look everything else stopped using.
const ACCENT = '#FFFFFF';      // --accent
const ON_ACCENT = '#0A0A0B';   // --on-accent
const BG = '#121214';          // rgb(var(--surface-rgb))
