// How this creator actually talks on camera, taken from their own Shorts.
//
// Ivan, 2026-10-10: scripts and outlines read like AI, not like the person
// filming them. The brain's "voice" field could not fix that: it is written
// from titles, so it comes out as "Direct, informal, fast-paced", which
// describes half of YouTube and gives a model nothing to copy. Five transcripts
// existed across all users, so there was no text to learn from either.
//
// So the model watches the creator's two best-performing Shorts and writes down
// what it hears: the opening lines verbatim, the words they reach for, how long
// their sentences run, what they put on screen. Writers then get real lines to
// match instead of adjectives. Built in the background (daily-ideas cron),
// checked weekly (the model only runs again when the month's top Shorts have
// changed), and absent for anyone without a connected channel, in which case
// everything falls back to the brain as before.
//
// The risk with handing a model real lines is that it pastes them back: in the
// first test a 30-second script used "literally" twice and every catchphrase in
// the list. So the block says what the examples are for, shows a different
// few each time, and caps their phrases at one per script.

How to use this: it is their register, not material. Match the sentence length, the plainness and the energy. Do not reuse those lines, and use at most one of their usual words in a script, only where it would come naturally. Whatever those videos were about is not a topic to bring back.
